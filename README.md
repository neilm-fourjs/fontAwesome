# fontAwesome
My Genero fontAwesome Viewer 


On Linux you can use the make file to build and run using the fontAwesome.4pw


# Notes:
The demos also uses the gl_lib repo which was added using:
* git submodule add https://github.com/neilm-fourjs/gl_lib.git gl_lib

If libraries change do:
* git submodule foreach git pull origin master
